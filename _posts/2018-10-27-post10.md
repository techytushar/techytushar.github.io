# Solve WiFi Problem in Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux) on a HP Laptop

Ever since I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop, its been a great companion but one problem that always troubled me was the WiFi connectivity. The problem was, only the WiFi with very strong signals strength would show up. So if I had to connect my mobile hotspot then I had to keep it very near to the laptop otherwise it won't detect it.

I searched a lot for it but nothing worked for me and recently one day I found an answer that solved the problem.

* First check what model of wireless adapter your computer has by using:

```bash
sudo lshw -C network
```

* If it is the same as `RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter` by `Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.` then the following steps should work fine for you, otherwise searching for it on google should easily give you a solution.

* Remove the unnecessary files

```bash
sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf
```

* Install the driver

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rtlwifi-new-dkms
```

Hope this helps. :slightly_smiling_face:
